# Kickdrum 

Similar to the tr-808 twin-t kickdrum.

## Description

Nice sounding kickdrum/bassdrum that can produce quite some bass. It features a combined control for pitch and decay/resonance, tone control and a overdrive, which add some harshness to the output signal.
Gerber files are coming in some weeks. The board will be quite small and there will be a 9V battery holder on the back of the pcb.
